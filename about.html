<h1>About Ellies Cakes</h1>

<h2> What is different about Ellie's Cakes? </h2>

<p> Have you ever met anyone that says "birthday cakes are too sweet"? This one line alone was insipration for Ellie.
  Ellie started baking as a hobby - eventually she became more and more engrossed in the
process, always tryig out new recipes, switching between different ingredients to get the perfect taste (her daughters usually being her taste testers)

Ellie's cakes are made with approximately 50% less sugar than other conventional cakes. Not only does this mean her cakes are
healthier - but the fact that she also uses less butter means her cakes are soft as a feather.
